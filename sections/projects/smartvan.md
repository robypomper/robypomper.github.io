The Smart Van solution is composed by a Box and a Mobile App.<br/>
Users can assemble their own box depending on their needs, then they can install
the mobile app and start using remote controls and smart features from their
new Smart Van.

As an Open project, on the official website will be published all schematics,

Mobile App, including their source code.
